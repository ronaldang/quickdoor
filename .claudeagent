## Step 4: Initial Prompt for Claude Code

Open Claude Code and paste this:
```
I'm building QuickDoor - a delivery address sharing app for Saudi consumers. 
Full context is in claude.md.

Let's start:

1. Initialize Next.js 14 project with:
   - TypeScript (strict mode)
   - Tailwind CSS
   - App Router
   - ESLint

2. Set up the basic file structure as defined in claude.md

3. Create placeholder components:
   - components/MapPicker.tsx
   - components/PhotoUpload.tsx  
   - components/AddressForm.tsx
   - components/AddressView.tsx

4. Set up Supabase client in lib/supabase.ts with TypeScript types

5. Create types/index.ts with the Address interface

Start with step 1. After each step completes, ask me for credentials 
if needed (Supabase, Google Maps) before proceeding.

Let's build fast! 🚀
