# QuickDoor - Simple Prototype

## Vision
A downloadable iOS Shortcut that auto-sends your location + photos via WhatsApp when delivery drivers call.

## What We're Building
1. **Static landing page** - explains solution, hosts download
2. **iOS Shortcut file** - pre-configured automation users can install

## Tech Stack
- Landing page: Static HTML + Tailwind CSS
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (free)
- Automation: iOS Shortcuts (native)
- No backend, no database, no ongoing costs

## How It Works

**User Setup (once):**
1. Download .shortcut file from website
2. Select 2-3 photos of their building
3. Type address instructions once
4. Install automation

**Daily Use:**
1. Enable "Delivery Mode" when ordering
2. Unknown number calls → WhatsApp auto-sends:
   - Location pin
   - Pre-selected photos  
   - Custom text message
